\# Advanced SQL Project: Airbnb Database



This project focuses on advanced SQL querying and optimization techniques on a simulated Airbnb database. The goal is to gain hands-on experience with joins, subqueries, and aggregation/window functions while analyzing and extracting meaningful insights.



\## Task 0: Complex Queries with Joins



\*\*Objective:\*\*  

Master SQL joins by writing complex queries using different types of joins.



\*\*Instructions Implemented:\*\*  

\- \*\*INNER JOIN:\*\* Retrieve all bookings and their respective users.  

\- \*\*LEFT JOIN:\*\* Retrieve all properties and their reviews, including properties without reviews.  

\- \*\*FULL OUTER JOIN:\*\* Retrieve all users and all bookings, including users without bookings and bookings without users.



\*\*Files:\*\*  

\- `joins\_queries.sql`

\## Task 1: Practice Subqueries



\*\*Objective:\*\*  

Write both correlated and non-correlated subqueries.



\*\*Instructions Implemented:\*\*  

\- \*\*Non-Correlated Subquery:\*\* Find all properties where the average rating is greater than 4.0.  

\- \*\*Correlated Subquery:\*\* Find users who have made more than 3 bookings.



\*\*Files:\*\*  

\- `subqueries.sql`

\## Task 2: Apply Aggregations and Window Functions



\*\*Objective:\*\*  

Use SQL aggregation and window functions to analyze data.



\*\*Instructions Implemented:\*\*  

\- \*\*Aggregations:\*\* Count total bookings made by each user.  

\- \*\*Window Functions:\*\* Rank properties based on the total number of bookings received using `ROW\_NUMBER` and `RANK`.



\*\*Files:\*\*  

\- `aggregations\_and\_window\_functions.sql`
